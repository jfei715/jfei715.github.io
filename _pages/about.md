I am a PhD student in the [Neuromotor Recovery Laboratory](https://sites.bu.edu/nrl/) at Boston University and a research fellow at the Harvard [Move Lab](https://www.movelab.seas.harvard.edu/). I am passionate about developing and validating advanced rehabilitation strategies and technologies tailored to individuals with neurological diseases that lead to movement impairments.

I received my Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from [Washington University in St. Louis (USA)](https://washu.edu/) in 2023 and my Bachelor of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering from Xuzhou Medical University in 2019. I also bring approximately two years of medical device industry experience from my time at [Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster](https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/companies/biosensewebster).

News
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Research Interests
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
