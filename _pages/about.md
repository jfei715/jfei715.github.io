I am a Rehabilitation Sciences PhD student in the [Neuromotor Recovery Laboratory](https://sites.bu.edu/nrl/) at [Boston University Sargent College](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/) and a research fellow at the [Harvard Move Lab](https://www.movelab.seas.harvard.edu/). I am passionate about developing and validating advanced rehabilitation strategies and technologies tailored to individuals with neurological diseases (such as stroke) that lead to movement impairments.

I received my Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from [Washington University in St. Louis (USA)](https://washu.edu/) in 2023 and my Bachelor of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering from Xuzhou Medical University (China) in 2019. I also bring approximately two years of medical device industry experience from my time at [Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster](https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/companies/biosensewebster).

Research Interests
------
* Indirect estimation of propulsion (anterior ground reaction forces) using clinically accessible variables from standard assessments and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs).
* **G**amified **R**ehabilitation with **E**lectrostimulation for **A**t-home **T**raining (**GREAT**): A gamified neuromotor assessment and training platform using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), IMUs, Dynamometer, and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).

News
------
* **2025/12/03:**  I was awarded a two-year [American Heart Association (AHA) Predoctoral Fellowship](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/predoctoral-fellowship) for my project titled "_Empowering Recovery at Home: A Gamified Neurostimulation Platform for Post-Stroke Neuromotor Assessment and Training_".
