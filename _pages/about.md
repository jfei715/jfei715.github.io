I am a Rehabilitation Sciences PhD student in the [Neuromotor Recovery Laboratory](https://sites.bu.edu/nrl/) at [Boston University Sargent College](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/) and a research fellow at the [Harvard Move Lab](https://www.movelab.seas.harvard.edu/). I am passionate about developing and validating advanced rehabilitation strategies and technologies tailored to individuals with neurological diseases (such as stroke) that lead to movement impairments.

I received my Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from [Washington University in St. Louis (USA)](https://washu.edu/) in 2023 and my Bachelor of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering from Xuzhou Medical University (China) in 2019. I also bring approximately two years of medical device industry experience from my time at [Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster](https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/companies/biosensewebster).

For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
